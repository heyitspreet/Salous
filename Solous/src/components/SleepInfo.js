          Getting less than 6 hours of sleep on a regular basis can have
          negative effects on your health and well-being: {'\n'}{'\n'}Fatigue - Lack
          of sleep makes you feel tired, sluggish, and unmotivated during the
          day. It reduces your cognitive performance and productivity. {'\n'}
          Weakened Immune System - Sleep deprivation compromises your immune
          system, making you more susceptible to infections and illnesses. Even
          a small loss of sleep can reduce the body's ability to fight off bugs.{' '}
          {'\n'}Weight Gain - Not getting enough sleep can disrupt hormones that
          regulate hunger and satiety. This causes increased appetite, sugar
          cravings, and higher risks of obesity over time. {'\n'}Heart Disease &
          Stroke - Chronic sleep loss is associated with higher blood pressure,
          cholesterol, and risk of cardiovascular disease over the long term.
          {'\n'}Diabetes - Studies show people getting less than 6 hours of
          sleep have a higher risk of developing diabetes compared to those
          getting 7-9 hours per night.{'\n'} Depressed Mood - Lack of sleep can
          exacerbate feelings of sadness, loneliness, anger, and generally
          create a negative outlook. It affects emotional regulation. {'\n'}
          Impaired Cognition - Sleep facilitates learning and memory encoding
          through neural recovery processes. Skimping on sleep degrades
          attention, working memory, decision making, and problem solving
          skills.

          You're Sleeping Too much Here are some potential cons of oversleeping ðŸ¥²:
          {'\n'}{'\n'}
          Sluggishness - Oversleeping may make you feel groggy, sluggish, and
          tired rather than well-rested. It throws off your natural sleep-wake
          cycle.
          {'\n'}Mental Health Issues - Studies link oversleeping to an increased
          risk of depression and anxiety in some people. It can be a symptom of
          underlying mental health issues.
          {'\n'}Weight Gain - Getting excessive sleep is linked to changes in
          hormone levels including reduced leptin and elevated ghrelin, which
          can boost appetite and fat accumulation over time.
          {'\n'}Headaches - Sleeping too long and missing morning sunlight can
          trigger headaches or migraines in those prone to them. The lack of
          exposure to daylight signals the brain to constrict blood vessels.
          {'\n'}Heart Disease - Research indicates prolonged oversleeping is
          associated with a modest increase in risk of heart disease, stroke,
          diabetes and early death, especially in older adults.
          {'\n'}Poor Productivity - Oversleeping leads to late starts, rushed
          mornings and less time getting things done during the day. It reduces
          your personal and professional productivity levels.
          {'\n'}Weakened Immunity â€“ Excessive time asleep may disrupt circadian
          rhythms and certain hormones, which can result in reduced immunity and
          frequent sickness.
